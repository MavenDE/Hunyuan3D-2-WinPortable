# Hunyuan3D-2 Windows Portable

A dedicated package for running
https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan3D-2[Hunyuan3D 2.0]
Gradio Web App (official demo) on Windows.

## How to Use - Generate Shape Only

image::docs/sc-white-mesh.webp["Screenshot"]

The simplest way to experience Hunyuan3D-2.
Input an image, and you'll get a 3D model (white mesh).

. Requirements:
** NVIDIA GPU with at least 6GB of VRAM (4GB may work but will be very slow). 
** GPU driver version must be newer than March 2024 (version >550).

. Download
https://github.com/YanWenKun/Hunyuan3D-2-WinPortable/releases/download/v1/Hunyuan3D2_WinPortable.7z[Hunyuan3D2_WinPortable.7z]
and extract it to a convenient location.

. Run `2-download-models.bat` and wait for the download to complete (~26GB).

. Run `3-run.bat`, ignore error messages about `EP Error`. Wait for the info message:

 Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

. Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser. Enjoy!

. Output files will be saved in `Hunyuan3D-2\gradio_cache`.

Other options:

* If your GPU has less than 6GB VRAM, use `run-very_low_vram.bat`.

* If you want to generate textures as well, see the instructions below.

##  How to Use - Generate Shape and Texture

image::docs/sc-textured-mesh.webp["Screenshot"]

Generating textures requires a few additional steps.

. Requirements:
** NVIDIA GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM (6GB may work but will be very slow). 
** GPU driver version must be newer than March 2024 (version >550).
** Minimum 24GB of system RAM.

. Install 
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-1-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&target_type=exe_network[CUDA Toolkit 12.4.1].

** Only
https://github.com/YanWenKun/Comfy3D-WinPortable/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/cuda-toolkit-install-selection.webp[Libraries and Compilers]
are needed to install.

. Install Visual Studio Build Tools 2022
(
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/[Page]
|
https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe[EXE]
).

** During setup, select the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

. Download and extract 
https://github.com/YanWenKun/Hunyuan3D-2-WinPortable/releases/download/v1/Hunyuan3D2_WinPortable.7z[Hunyuan3D2_WinPortable.7z].
Or check for newer versions at
https://github.com/YanWenKun/Hunyuan3D-2-WinPortable/releases[releases page].

. Run `update.bat` to ensure you have the latest code.

. Run `1-compile-install-texture-gen.bat`, wait for the installation to finish.

. Run `2-download-models.bat` to download necessary models (~26GB).

. Run `3-run.bat`. When ready, the following message will appear:

 Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

** If you see `EP Error: Can't load TensorRT`, the app will automatically fallback to CUDA. This error can be safely ignored.

. Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

. Output files will be saved in `Hunyuan3D-2\gradio_cache`.

Other options:

* Use `run-very_low_vram.bat` if your GPU has less than 8GB VRAM.

## How to use - Text to 3D

image::docs/sc-text-to-3d.webp["Screenshot"]

The Text to 3D feature combines:
(1) Text to Image
(2) Image to 3D.
For an experienced user, it might not be worth downloading another Text-to-Image model. Therefore, this feature is disabled by default. However, you can easily enable it:

* After the `2-download-models.bat` script completes, run `run-with-text_to_3d.bat`. 
This will download the required models (~13.4GB) and start the app. 
If the download fails, simply re-run the script.

* Texture Generation feature is optional for Text-to-3D. You can always get a white mesh without installing texgen.

By the way, the HunyuanDiT model works great for this purpose.

## Tips

. The "Remove Background" feature uses `rembg` with default settings, which may leave faint white edges. Turn it off if your images already have clean alpha channels.

. I have 24GB VRAM! Let the app use more!

** Edit `run-very_low_vram.bat`, replace `--profile 5` with `--profile 1`.
** Beneath this argument, is the
https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Hunyuan3D-2GP[Hunyuan3D-2GP]
made by
https://github.com/deepbeepmeep[DeepBeepMeep].
** You can find more detail about profile level on
https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/mmgp#usage[mmgp manual].

. To update:

** Run `update.bat`.
** Note: This package uses a
https://github.com/YanWenKun/Hunyuan3D-2[customized fork] of Hunyuan3D 2.0, maintained by me, which might not always be up-to-date.

. Need to set a proxy for Internet access?

** Add the following lines on top to any script you run into issues with, adjusting for your proxy server:

```
set HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:1080
set HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:1080

```
